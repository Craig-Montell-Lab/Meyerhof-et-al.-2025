Code used for tracking mosquitoes in Meyerhof, Dhavan, and Blunk et al. (2025). Use "Launch_tracker.m" file to launch tracking script. Note, code assumes that each video file is saved in a separate folder. This code was optimized to track mosquitoes in the shadow-threat assay found in Meyerhof, Dhavan, and Blunk et al. (2025). It has not been tested on other experimental setups. 
In order to run the Analysis.m script, each video must be paired with timestamps for each frame (times.txt) and the stage position (StagePositions.txt)
